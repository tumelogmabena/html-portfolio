<h1>The Best Series To Watch</h1>
<p>By Tumelo G Mabena</p>

<h2>1. How To Get Away With Murder</h2>
<p>This was one great show that kept me glued onto the screen for 
   several weeks, withou any loss in interest or bordom . HTGAWM is
   about the accidental murder of a lecturers husband by a group of
   students and the lecturer helping them get away with it. From the 
   first episode you're hooked, I believe it was well written and
   directed. Tried to make it my Christamas tradition to watch every
   year, lol.</p>

<h2>2. Suits</h2>
<p>
    Suits is a show where one could genuinely be exposed to my commitment
    when it comes to watching shows. I think I have been battling with 
    this watch for almost 2 years now. Its a really great watch dont get
    me wrong but when a show of 45 mins per episode, and has 16 episodes
    per season and has round about 9 seasons, I bet anyone will have problems
    commiting till the end. This show is about a false lawyer who is a
    great lawyer, who works under the greates law firm under the greates
    lawyer in town. As they fight for their clients they are also fighting
    to not get caught in thier little act.

<h2>3. The 100</h2>
<p>
    The 100, was such a great watch, puting it 3rd on the list is for technical
    reasons. The show itself is great but my personal opinion is there isn't
    much of evolution both in the characters and the story line, yes the show is 
    primarily about survival, but pulling in aspects other than survival wouldnt 
    a bad thing at all. The ending as well didnt sit well with me, but hey I finished
    the show, I hardly do that.
